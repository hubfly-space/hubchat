# Public API

Hubchat publishes the versioned REST contract as [OpenAPI 3.1](../embedded/openapi.json).
Running deployments serve the exact contract embedded in the binary at
`/api/v1/openapi.json`.

The API is workspace-scoped. Browser clients normally authenticate with the
Hubchat session cookie; server integrations use a workspace-scoped API key in
the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header and may select the workspace explicitly
with `Hubchat-Workspace-Id`.

All errors use the standard envelope described in
[`api-conventions.md`](api-conventions.md), including a request ID. List
endpoints use opaque cursor pagination. Retryable creates and actions should
send an `Idempotency-Key`.

The checked-in document is generated from
[`openapi.template.json`](../embedded/openapi.template.json) with
`node scripts/generate-openapi.mjs`; `make openapi-check` validates the
published artifact.
